Observations from Pyber data

1. The average number of drivers per city is highest for urban cities and lowest for rural cities.
2. The pie charts for "percent of total rides by city type" and "percent of total fares" by city type are almost identical,
   indicating that each city has the same value for average ride fare.
3. the number of drivers by city type does not correlate to the number of rides by city type. Urban cities have over 78% of the total 
   drivers but only do 49.1% of the rides.
